# Expense Tracker -- Budget App ðŸ“±
Expense Tracker app this simple Python project allows users to track their expenses, categorize them, and monitor their budget on a monthly basis. It provides a straightforward interface for entering expenses, saving them to a CSV file, and summarizing spending habits.

- The diagram features expense.py, encapsulating essential data fields: name (str), category (str), and amount (float). Opting for a class was motivated by the goal to consolidate these elements into a cohesive structure, favoring it over a list or dictionary. After creating the class, the plan is to import it into another application, maintaining a separation of logic and data model for organizational clarity. This strategy streamlines the application's primary focuses: user input, CSV file writing, and generating a summary. The summary entails file reading and calculations to determine the total and remaining budget for the specified month.
